# About 

I began my tech career at fifteen as the co-founder and CTO of MotherNature.com, a leading online vitamin supplier that went public with a peak market cap of $600M. By nineteen, I co-founded MediaWebcast, a trans-media company that peaked at $70M in market cap. At twenty-one, I founded Odin Metatech, a company that developed enterprise content management software primarily for the medical sector. Alongside its core CMS offerings, Odin Metatech also provided complementary SEO/SEM and custom software development services to its clients.

Later, I served as CTO at TASER International (now AXON), spearheading the Evidence.com SaaS product. My career in San Diego included roles as interim CTO and advisor for several tech companies, enriching my experience in various programming languages and architectures.

In 2013, I co-founded Drone Universities and TheraJoy, enhancing my portfolio in technology and health. Drone Universities offers nationwide, in-person drone training across all 50 U.S. states, targeting both enthusiasts and professionals. TheraJoy provides CBD products tailored for seniors, focusing on relief for conditions like arthritis and promoting overall wellness. By 2016, I was responsible for the engineering efforts at Sestra Systems, innovating in IoT and battery technologies.


Currently, I work as a consultant specializing in software and prompt engineering. I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup using AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and bias detection. This role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
