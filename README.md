I am a software engineer with over [$(($(grep -oP "d+(?= years of experience)" README.md) + 1)) years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samestrin/), including C-level roles in public and private companies.  I consult actively, architecting, developing, and deploying software solutions. In my free time, I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup that uses AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and political bias detection. This role has deepened my expertise in AI and prompt engineering.
