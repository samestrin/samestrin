# About 

I am a consultant in software engineering and prompt design with over 28 years of experience. In my free time, I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup using AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and bias detection. This role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
