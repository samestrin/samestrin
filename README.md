# About 

I began my tech career at fifteen as the co-founder and CTO of MotherNature.com, which went public with a $600M market cap. By nineteen, I had co-founded MediaWebcast, a trans-media company valued at $70M. At twenty-one, I established Odin Metatech, developing content management software for the medical sector. Later, as CTO at TASER International (now AXON), I led the development of the Evidence.com SaaS product. My subsequent roles in San Diego further diversified my experience in various programming languages and architectures. In 2013, I co-founded Drone Universities, offering nationwide drone training, and TheraJoy, providing CBD products for senior wellness. In 2016, I led the engineering efforts at Sestra Systems, innovating in IoT and battery technologies.

Currently, I am a consultant in software engineering and prompt design and am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup using AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and bias detection. This role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
