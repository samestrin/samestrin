With over [29 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samestrin/) in software engineering, including C-level roles at both public and private companies, I actively consult on architecting, developing, and deploying software solutions. In my free time, I contribute to a politically oriented stealth startup, leveraging AI to address challenges like political bias detection and scoring, semantic content analysis, and sentiment analysis. This work has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and prompt engineering.
