# About 

My name is Sam Estrin, and my career began at fifteen as a co-founder and original CTO of MotherNature.com, the world's largest online vitamin and supplement supplier at the time. The company went public in 1999, reaching a peak market cap of $600M.

At nineteen, I co-founded MediaWebcast, a publicly traded trans-media company creating cable TV shows for revenue generation through content partnerships. As CTO, I managed TV show websites, infrastructure, and developed software products like MediaLimiter, contributing to the company's valuation. MediaWebcast reached a peak market cap of $70M.

At twenty-one, I founded Odin Metatech, offering boutique technology solutions, including Odin Organic Framework and Odin Assemble. The company rapidly expanded to provide consulting services in SEO/SEM, compliance, and security.

At twenty-eight, I joined TASER International (Now AXON) as CTO, leading development activities within the Evidence.com division and creating the Evidence.com SaaS product. I was responsible for architectural planning, security policy development, managing UX and Solr search teams, and ETM (Evidence Transfer Mechanism) software development.

In 2010, I worked in San Diego, serving as interim CTO, SVP of Engineering, Advisor, and Board Member for businesses like Mindtouch, Inc., Chatmeter, MojoPages, and Geekli.st. This period allowed me to gain hands-on experience with additional languages and architectures, such as Java and Mono.

In 2013, I became an independent consultant and co-founded Drone Universities, a nationwide drone training school. At thirty-five, I co-founded TheraJoy, a CBD product company, where I developed METIS, an industry-specific asset-tracking software.

In 2016, I joined Sestra Systems as Director of Engineering, reporting directly to the CEO. I managed software development and QA teams for the Sestra IoT product and contributed by developing battery technologies that expanded market opportunities.

I am currently engaged as a consultant specializing in software engineering and prompt design, and I am also involved with a politically oriented stealth startup that leverages artificial intelligence. This venture focuses on harnessing AI to tackle several challenges, including efficient categorization, effective topic grouping, identifying trending issues, and detecting biases in content. My involvement has significantly deepened my expertise in AI technologies and Prompt Engineering, enabling me to contribute effectively to the development and refinement of advanced AI applications.
