**About:**

I am a software engineer with over 28 years of experience. In my free time, I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup that uses AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and political bias detection; this role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
