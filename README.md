## About 

I am a software engineering and prompt design consultant with over 28 years of experience. In my free time, I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup that uses AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and bias detection. This role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.

I enjoy working with Node.js, PHP, and Python.
