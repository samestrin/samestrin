# About 

I began my tech career at fifteen as the co-founder and CTO of MotherNature.com, a leading online vitamin supplier that went public with a peak market cap of $600M. By nineteen, he co-founded MediaWebcast, a trans-media company that peaked at $70M in market cap. At twenty-one, Sam Estrin founded Odin Metatech, a company that developed enterprise content management software primarily for the medical sector. Alongside its core CMS offerings, Odin Metatech also provided complementary SEO/SEM and custom software development services to its clients.

Later, he served as CTO at TASER International (now AXON), spearheading the Evidence.com SaaS product. His career in San Diego included roles as interim CTO and advisor for several tech companies, enriching his experience in various programming languages and architectures.

In 2013, Estrin co-founded Drone Universities and TheraJoy, enhancing his software development portfolio. By 2016, he was responsible for the engineering efforts at Sestra Systems, innovating in IoT and battery technologies.

Currently, Estrin is a consultant in software engineering and prompt design and is involved in a politically oriented stealth startup using AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and bias detection. This role has significantly deepened his expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
