I am a seasoned software engineer with over [28 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samestrin/), actively consulting to architect, develop, and deploy software solutions. In my free time, I am involved in a politically oriented stealth startup that uses AI to address challenges such as categorization, topic grouping, and political bias detection; this role has significantly deepened my expertise in AI and Prompt Engineering.
